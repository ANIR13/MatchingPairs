Build a responsive web-based "Memory Matching Card Game" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React if possible).

🃏 Game Mechanics:

Display a grid of cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x4).

Each card has a hidden image. There are exactly two of each image.

When the game starts, all cards are face down.

The player clicks to flip two cards at a time:

If the images match, keep both cards face up and marked as "matched".

If they don’t match, flip them back down after 1 second.

Track number of attempts and matched pairs.

Show a win message when all pairs are matched.

🎨 Design Requirements:

Use a clean and modern design with animations on card flips.

Make the layout responsive for desktop and mobile.

Add a "Restart" button to reset the game.

🧠 Optional Enhancements:

Add timer and best score tracking.

Add sound effects for flipping/matching.

Use emoji or animal images for cards.
